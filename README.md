# IPS-SPREADS

This repository contains the Infestation Pattern Simulation Supporting PREdisposition DetailS (IPS-SPREADS) as presented in the study Pietzsch et al. (2021, submitted). Each Folder contains the files listed below for each of the three modeling steps: testing (sensitivity analysis), calibrating (calibration) and experiments (application) as described and discussed in the submitted study.
List of contents of each folder:
+ a model file of IPS-SPREADS,
+ model input data (directory input),
+ model output data (directory output),
+ processed results (file results.csv) and,
+ the corresponding R script used for the data procession and visualization.

In some cases additional files are provided (for example the coordinates of the used research areas).
