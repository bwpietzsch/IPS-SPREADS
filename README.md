# IPS-SPREADS

This repository contains the Infestation Pattern Simulation Supporting PREdisposition DetailS (IPS-SPREADS) as presented in the study Pietzsch et al. (2021, submitted). Each Folder contains the files listed below for each of the three modeling steps: testing (sensitivity analysis), calibrating (calibration) and experiments (application) as described and discussed in the submitted study.
List of contents of each folder:
+ a model file of IPS-SPREADS,
+ model input data (directory input),
+ model output data (directory output),
+ processed results (file results.csv) and,
+ the corresponding R script used for the data procession and visualization.

In the application directory an additional file is provided which contains the coordinates of the used research areas. In the other directories, the coordinates are included directly within the respective R script.
